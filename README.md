Market integration in a transitional hunter-gatherer population benefits men, not women
Economic and subsistence transitions create wealth and health disparity. Sometimes transitions benefit one sex (usually male) or disadvantage the other (usually female). Hunter-gatherer societies with social hierarchies beyond a gender-based division of labor follow this pattern when groups make the transition from hunting-gathering to market economies. We applied non-invasive methods for assessing health during early childhood (ages 1-5) and found men’s health improves in response to market integration and women’s does not change. The health biomarker used is linear enamel hypoplasias, specifically the presence of missing enamel in permanent teeth which indicate stress during growth and development. We used a time series analysis (date of birth) relative to the frequency of teeth having a hypoplastic marker to test whether gender-based health differences occurred over time. Starting about 40 years ago, younger generations of Hadza men experienced less childhood stress than women and older generations. The transition to a market economy in bush-living Hadza has benefitted men’s health, but not women’s health. The broader implications are that the sex-based division of labor in hunting-gatherer societies is exacerbated by external forces favouring males over females.
